*NOTES TO REMEMBER*
Project Name: MvcMovie = BowlsApp
Movie App = Bowl Buyer App
Movie = Bowl

October 13
Now that i have finished my midterm for my javascript and i can give my full undivided attention to it, I think it is a good time
to make a final version of this type of project for the assignment detailed in class.


4:10
Set up my GitHub reposit:
after a bit of struggle with my password I was able to get in and set up the needed repositiory for my assignment.

4:13
I realized that the computer I am using does not have visual studio 2019 installed, I will have to relocate to a different computer. 

4:20
Now on a new computer I began my project and saved it to a folder called BowlsApp on my computer.

4:32
After struggling for a bit trying to find where to change the address to not include https:// allowing me to run it on the school computer i've decided to do as much as I can for
now until I can fix that issue.

4:35
Created the HelloWorld Controller and added the content

4:40
Changed the contents of the controller's welcome method

4:45
After reading the tutorial more, I went back and changed the contents of the controller's welcome method again

4:47
And once again I changed the contents of the controller's welcome method

4:54
I decided I have to go back and fix the URL before progressing any further, what I've completed so far wouldn't be hard to reprouce if there are errors but
if I get much further and have to restart then I could lose a lot of time. I read online to change the url found when looking at the properties of the app but it did not work
I will continue to look for a solution.

4:49
I found a URL in the settings and removed the HTTP:// but this only broke my code.
After reverting my change to how it previously was my code will not even build successfully, I suppose I will have to restart.

5:10
After rebuilding the project,
with some great luck I managed to figure out what the problem is, I think anyways, my previous solution was very close, I had to leave the url as was and deselect the SSL option
from below it, now I am able to open my app and it is time to remake a controller.

5:14
I've redone the first part of the controller and tested, I am able to reach both endpoints I've created.

5:17
I've tested and ran the final version of the controller. Now I can finally add the veiw.


5:19
I've changed the Index method to return view.

5:21
Added the HelloWorld folder under views and created the index view

5:25
chnaged the contents of the newly created veiw and tested the code

5:30
Changed some of the lines in the layout to say the name of the app, Bowl Buyer App, and tested.


5:35
changed the view quickly making a new title

5: 37
Changed the contents of the controller's welcome method

5:41
Added a new view called welcome and changed it's contents so it will run correctly
finally after that I tested ending part 3

5:42
Although I am in a flow and I am happy with the progress I am making, I have a class to get to so I will resume this after if I am able to

7:12
Done with my other class, now back to this assignment

7:15
added Bowl.cs under models and added it's contents, I remember something being changed about the next step
involving NuGet Package Manager but I can't remember exactly what, I will have to look for the solution.

7:20 
From what I can understand the change was that I didn't have to run the command to install the framework in the console. I did and got an error and will continue the project as
instructed by the tutorial

7:27
After trying to continue on, I have an error with the line Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore. I'm not sure if it is because I do not have the Entity framework because I missed
a step or if the line is uneeded. For now I have decided to comment out the line in hopes that it is not needed, if another error appears, I will have to work that out before
continuing further.

7:35
Unfortunately I am out of time for today so I will have to come back to this error, my attempt to continue has only resulted in more errors so I will have to sort this
out before continuing.

10:15
I tried to arrive earlier to school today so I could make progress on this assignment

10:18
after a few short minutes, I've realized that I forgot to save the assignment to my GitHub account, I will have to go back to the machine that I was on in order to upload it

10:32
after asking for permission, I am at my computer and uploading it to the GitHib allowing me to continue my work at the SRC lab

10:40
I've returned to the lab, now to see if I can fix the eroor I was having yesterday

11:35
I've tried every solution and tab I thought might help and I tried looking over the lecture files as well as using google to try and help but
unfortunately with no success, I will ask for help solving this issue in class today.

11:55
Erlier when moving my project to GitHub I forgot to move my read me file, I have now updated it with everything I've done so far today

12:16
While I wait to get help fixing that error, I am proceding with the assignment putting new code in comments so that it is easier to add
in step by step after the assignment is fixed

12:30
While setting up the rest of the project I attempted to build the scaffold detailed in the tutorial and suddenly my previous error was fixed, I beleive it automatically installed entity framework core
allowing me to progres my project.

12:37
Now frustratingly although the rest of my code shows no errors and I've added in the code that was commented before as well as corrected all those errors,
I am having an error that will not allow me to add my scaffold, it states that there is no parameterless constructor defined for the type BowlsApp.Data.BowlsContext
I see no issue with that file. For now I suppose I will skip this step hoping that I can get help or lucky again

1:27
Andrew did something, he said he does not know what, but everything seems to be working, so I'm very happy.

1:31
I've tested everything around the code so far and everythings looking good, now i will continue with the tutorial

2:00
A small break for lunch then back to work

3:53
I'm having an error where the table has the rating column, but nothing appears in it.

4:35
I have completed the next part in the tutorial, adding a rating to my page but for some reason the text isn't appearing on my page, I have another class soon so I will have
to fix the error and finish this up after class

5:50
My other class was very short but that gives me more time to work on this assignment

6:17
I'm not sure how but changing the text of the rating has suddenly allowed it to work, now to finish up the rest of the tutorial

6:32
I have completed the tutorial but now there is an issue where upon edidting an entry, it says that the URL cannot be found, I have went over the work I've just
done 2 or 3 times but cannot find what is wrong, I will have to seek out help for this one. For now I'll see if I can figure out how to customize the styles

6:55
After trying to edit the site.css file and seeing no changes, I will have to put more time into figuring out which file needs to be edited. For now it is starting
to get dark so I will go home for the evening, overall I am happy with the progress I have made today.
